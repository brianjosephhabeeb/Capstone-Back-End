## 6.  Wins and Struggles

### Wins
- The back end proved to be much easier than I had anticipated.  I enacted the plan I had put in place and followed it to the "t".  I met my timeline goals each day, which set me up to devote plenty of time on the front end portion of the project.

### Struggles
- I wanted to add a two more endpoints for my API calls but decided against it and I am glad I did.
